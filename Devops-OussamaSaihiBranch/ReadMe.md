🚀 I've just completed a robust project managing the full software development lifecycle, and I'm thrilled to share my journey!
From start to finish, I've orchestrated an end-to-end hashtag#DevOps workflow to build, test, monitor, and deploy a multi-tiered application using cutting-edge technologies and industry-standard practices. The project's core components included:

🛠️ Managing with Maven & Git: Leveraged Maven for robust Spring Boot application management and Git with GitHub for version control and source code management.

🔍 Unit Testing & Code Quality: Rigorously tested with JUnit & Mockito and ensured high code quality using JaCoCo.

🔗 Tight Integration with GitHub: Used Ngrok for seamless integration between Jenkins and GitHub to automate pipeline builds on every push.

🎯 Quality Analysis with SonarQube: Ensured top-notch code quality and identified areas for improvement using SonarQube.

📦 Artifact Hosting with Nexus3: Hosted and managed artifacts effectively using Nexus3.

🐳 Docker Environment Configuration: Set up a reliable working environment with Docker and DockerCompose for Spring, MySQL, and Angular.

📊 Performance Monitoring with Grafana & Prometheus: Monitored performance and server health for comprehensive insight into the Jenkins server.

⚙️ CI/CD with Jenkins Pipeline: Engineered a robust continuous integration and delivery pipeline with Jenkins to automate the software lifecycle.

🤝 Collaboration on Slack: Utilized Slack to streamline collaboration and communicate the pipeline state for seamless teamwork.

🚀 Continuous Deployment to DockerHub: Enabled continuous deployment by pushing generated Docker images to DockerHub.

Each stage of this project was carefully crafted to ensure a seamless, efficient, and automated software development process. I'm excited to share more insights and experiences from this journey in the world of DevOps!
